2048playa
=========

autononous 2048 player

To try, do

ant run

(You will need yank.jar in ant/lib (found on maven central)


Launches a browser, points at http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/ and plays the game.

Since it uses 'image processing' to find the game and play it, it might be sensitive to
different operation systems, monitors etc. It works on mint, at least :)
